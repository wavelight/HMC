# HMC : Open Source Motor Controller.

Software part of HMC.

Debug : VSCode. 'Cortex Debug' extension(OpenOCD)
Compile : arm-none-eabi-gcc(makefile made by CubeMX)
Download : ST-Link

I have not tested it yet, but I am pretty sure this setup will work on other platform as well.

I will update about this later.

Note : This source is for STM32F4-Discovery board. 
As I said on <a href="https://heeyo.blog/2018/03/10/decided-to-hold-h-w-part-of-esc/" target="_blank">my blog</a>, I decided to work on software alogrithm first with discovery board and DRV development board.
